      Hi, I'm Ian! I studied Mechanical Engineering at McMaster University, and have always had a strong interest in automation and robotics.
        In my free time, I'm either building something or playing piano. I'm always trying to learn something new, which is why I've been learning to code through online resources and personal projects. With technology advancing so quickly, there is always something new and exciting to play around with.
